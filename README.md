# College
I finished my Bachelor's programme at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering(Academic study programme) in the capital city of Slovenia, Ljubljana. 

My title is diplomirani inženir elektrotehnike (UN), the abbreviated form of the title is dipl. inž. el. (UN).

The repository holds reports from a few subjects where we had to present them digitally. Needless to say that in our establishment we did an abundance of different subjects that I am unable to showcase in a Github enviroment. I do however wish to provide my curicullum to help clerify the scope of my knowledge. I would like to add that I attended the 2nd semester in my last year of college as part of the Erasmus+ program in Bucharest: Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology(ETTI) UPB and had a few subjects in the Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Robotics(FIR).

## Notable software used during the curriculum:
C, JavaScript, MatLab, WolframAlpha, Labview, LTspice, Arduino IDE, Dymola, Logic Friday
